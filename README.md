### Hi there 👋

#### Welcome to my GitHub corner! 🚀

I'm currently rockin' it as a Senior Member Tech (SDE2) at D.E.Shaw India, where I'm part of the Python Infrastructure team, making magic happen behind the scenes. ✨

While I haven't been the most active in the open-source community, who knows what the future holds? 🤔 I might just dive headfirst into contributing and shaking things up a bit. Maybe I'm fueled by a dash of ADHD 🫵🏼, or perhaps I just appreciate the art of procrastination. 😅

Stay tuned to my profile because I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. Here's what you might catch me working on (in no particular order):

- Neovim plugins 🎨
- CLI tools ⚙️
- Parsers & Compilers 🖥️

(Handcrafted by ChatGPT, sprinkled with a dash of my flair)
